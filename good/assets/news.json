Community workshops were held to train farmers on efficient water use, and children in nearby villages were given small educational kits explaining the importance of sustainable irrigation. Additionally, a small fishery has emerged in the newly dug canals, providing supplementary income to families. Officials noted that the project has also attracted attention from neighboring provinces, with delegations visiting to learn from the initiative."
