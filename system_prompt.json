Given a short prose excerpt, produce a JSON object with these keys: \n- original: the original text string.\n- decoded: a concise plain-language interpretation of the subtext (1-3 sentences).\n- flags: an array of phrases or keywords in the text that indicate bureaucratic euphemism, erasure, censorship, or coercion.\n- glossary_matches: array of canonical glossary terms (from the provided glossary) matched and why.\n- suggested_reading: one-sentence suggestion for how a trained reader should mentally archive or act on this text.\nAlways output only valid JSON. If you refer to sources, include them in a 'sources' array using filenames from the data/ folder. Do not output any surrounding commentary, only the JSON object."
