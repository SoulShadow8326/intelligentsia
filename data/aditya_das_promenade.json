  "body": "The new promenade reliefs, commissioned by the Municipal Union, are a study in restraint: planned curves, reduced ornament, and a limited palette that ties one boulevard to the next. Walkers have praised the feeling of continuity; visitors say the design helps them move through the city without distraction. There is a genuine artistry in taking many voices and resolving them into a single line that reads cleanly from end to end.\n\nThis unity serves a practical end. When sculpture, lighting, and signage all follow the same plan, wayfinding improves, maintenance becomes efficient, and the whole city benefits from economies of scale. The artist collective worked within the brief and delivered craft that supports public life.\n\nStill, some longtime patrons recall a different decade, when edges were sharper and debates lasted longer. That memory is carried in quiet conversation at the cafés — a gentle ache, not so loud as to unsettle children, but persistent. Purity of line comforts the many; for those who remember variance, the uniformity feels like a choice taken on their behalf. We can celebrate the relief’s technical success while honoring the memory of an earlier, less ordered practice.",
